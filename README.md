# Stepper Form

Create a simple sign-in stepper form. A multi-step form which guides the user to enter info in the form step by step.

The form needs to indicate to the user progress and an alert if something is not correct. It needs to allow user to go back and edit already filled-in fields.

The goal is to have three or more fields that guides the user from start to finish.

This is an example form only and doesn't send info anywhere to the web. So don't be afraid to test it out.

Core requirements:

- HTML and CSS
- Vanilla Javascript only (no libraries)
- a minimum of 3 steps
- clean and intuitive
- reusable and responsive
- with validation
